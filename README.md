# Tetra Reborn Localization
This is the source of the localization files used in Tetra Reborn.
The Tetra Reborn files are sourced in the Ruby on Rails YAML format for pluralization handling on services
like Crowdin. This repo has a feature to compile these to a JSON format for use in the game, as the game
uses i18next.
